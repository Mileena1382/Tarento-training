                                                         Shortcuts in IDE(PyCharm)
    
    1.Run/Debug: Shift + F10 (Windows/Linux), Control + Shift + R (Mac)
        This shortcut allows you to quickly run or debug your Python program without navigating through the menu or toolbar. 
        It helps in executing your code and displaying the output or starting the debugging process.

    2.Go to Definition: Ctrl + Left Click (Windows/Linux), Command + Left Click (Mac)
        By placing the cursor on a symbol (e.g., a function or a class) and using this shortcut, you can quickly navigate 
        to its definition. It helps in understanding implementation details or efficiently exploring the codebase.

    3.Format Code: Ctrl + Alt + L (Windows/Linux), Option + Command + L (Mac)
        This shortcut helps maintain consistent code formatting. By selecting a block of code or placing the cursor in a 
        file and pressing the shortcut, PyCharm automatically reformats the code based on the configured code style 
        settings.

    4.Rename: Shift + F6
        Using this shortcut, you can quickly rename a symbol (e.g., a variable, function, or class) throughout your
        codebase. By placing the cursor on the symbol and pressing the shortcut, PyCharm opens a dialog to enter the 
        new name, automatically updating all references to the symbol.

    5.Extract Variable/Method: Ctrl + Alt + V/M (Windows/Linux), Command + Option + V/M (Mac)
        These shortcuts are useful for refactoring and improving code readability. By selecting a block of code and
        pressing the respective shortcut (V for variable, M for method), PyCharm extracts the selected code into a 
        new variable or method, respectively.
